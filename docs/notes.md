# Welcome to FormWizard!
This project demonstrates basic form handling in React, including a styled UI and field validation.

The current focus of this project is frontend and so will stub out backend services.

## Scope
- create account
- login
- create business entity
- update business rule compliance

## Ideas & Takeaways
- extensible model, business rule with corresponding React component
- implement backend on Ethereum, particularly the business rules and user's current compliance status with their associated rules.
- activity feed approach to user onboarding and interaction, very mobile friendly
- interesting considerations for moving from "nailing it" to "scaling it"

## TODO:
- DONE! Create react app
- DONE! Model data
- DONE! TDD data object and draft functions to stub out backend
- DONE! Install storybook
- DONE! Install form libraries
- Wireframe, quick and as lofi as possible
- Create UI end-to-end skeleton/happy path
- UI, full data
- polish

## STRETCH:
- set alerts for certain business rules, especially to biz dev
- admin dashboard, drive user conversion
- upload PDFs, shareholder agreement and ID (potential for IPFS)
- create backend (Ethereum, IPFS?, MongoDB?)
