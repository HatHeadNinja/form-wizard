# Welcome to FormWizard!
This project demonstrates basic React form handling, including UI and business rule validation, and displays progress and status of the user's current business rule complicance status.

The current focus of this project is form handling and so will stub out auth/login and database server for a later time.

This repo will likely become private.

## Other Takeaways
- implement backend on Ethereum, particularly the business rules and user's current compliance status with their associated rules.
- different approach to user onboaring and interaction, very mobile friendly
- interesting considerations for moving from "nailing it" to "scaling it"

## TODO:
- DONE! Create react app
- IN PROCESS! Model data, reflect existing fields/values
- Wireframe screens, quick and as lofi as possible
- Structure data objects and create draft functions
- Create UI end-to-end skeleton, happy path with no styling
- UI, full data
- polish!

STRETCH:
- upload PDFs, shareholder agreement and ID (potential for IPFS)
- set alerts for certain business rules, including and especially to biz dev
- add users, Auth0
