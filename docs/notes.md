This project started as a demonstration of basic form handling in React using Yup for form validation. Now, going to finish it up as a configurable web3 form wizard. Polygon sidechain.

## Scope
- connect to wallet
- create form flow
- payment
- share form flow with users
- form flow dashboard
- admin dashboard
- update form flow progress

## Ideas & Takeaways
- activity feed approach to user onboarding and interaction, very mobile friendly
- extensible model, with business rules matching corresponding React components
- implement backend on Polygon, particularly entity's current compliance status with associated business rules.

## TODO:
- Set up environment, including truffle, ganache, etc
- Connect to wallet
- Logged In/Out state
- Model data/smart contracts
- Wireframe, quick and as lofi as possible
- Create UI end-to-end skeleton/happy path
