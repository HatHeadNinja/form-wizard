# Welcome to FormWizard!
This project demonstrates basic form handling in React using Yup for form validation.

The current focus of this project is frontend and so will stub out backend services.

## Scope
- create business entity
- update business rule compliance

## Ideas & Takeaways
- activity feed approach to user onboarding and interaction, very mobile friendly
- extensible model, with business rules matching corresponding React components
- implement backend on Ethereum, particularly entity's current compliance status with associated business rules.

## TODO:
- DONE! Create react app
- DONE! Model data
- DONE! TDD data object and draft functions to stub out backend
- DONE! Install storybook
- DONE! Install form libraries
- DONE! Wireframe, quick and as lofi as possible
- Create UI end-to-end skeleton/happy path
- UI, full data
- polish

## STRETCH:
- set alerts for certain business rules, especially to biz dev
- admin dashboard, drive user conversion
- upload PDFs, shareholder agreement and ID (potential for IPFS)
- create backend (Ethereum, IPFS?, MongoDB?)
